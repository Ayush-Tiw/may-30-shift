                                           REACT DAY-1

Difference between js and reactjs?
reactjs is library we install it as npm react
angularjs vs reactjs
library vs framework

Virtual DOM: blueprint of real DOM
it has two state previous state and next state
wheneveer we change any state variable it compare previous state and next state and only changed element will we updated in real DOM  not the whole DOM 
react also has real DOM  but it will not use it untill it is required

single page application:when we click(mounting) on any other link(component) in page only url and content will change and existing component gets unmounted and also it does not refer to other tab
we have many different component in one single page when we click on any component(link) it get mounted and other is unmounted 
//it will not reload again and again only the main content is changed(react docs)
see wikipedia  it will load again and again
ex:react docs

JSX:javascript xml
previously we use DOM manipuation to communicate between js and html
but in react we can write js code inside html by using {}
it reduces complexcity of code
